- 👋 Hi, I’m Anita.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, reading, exploring, swimming, hanging out and baking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Spanish, French, Chinese languages along with C, R, JavaScript and other languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on something easy, because I am just a beginner.
- 😃 I am very shy and bit insecure, but once I am comfortable, I am a very open and interesting person. 
I am looking forward to meeting new people, making new friends, and working on projects.
